        <h3>World class web developer.</h3>
        <p>When you hear the word world-class, what pops into your mind? you must visualize a badass that could find the solution to any technical problem within a blink of an eye or a smart computer genius that knows every technical jargon. Well, you are not entirely wrong but at the same time, there are some important attributes or trait a person must possess before they can be called a world-class developer. Outlined below are the skills, please add to the list if you noticed that I am missing anything using the comment box below.</p>
